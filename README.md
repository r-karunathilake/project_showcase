- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @r-karunathilake, ðŸ“« You can reach me at karunath@ualberta.ca.

This repository was created to hold my personal project files. Each project is separated into directories and the description of each is as follows:

"EM_Field_Visualization": this directory contains code for visualizing simulated electromagnetic field data for nanostructures. The code here uses key Python libraries such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pandas. 

"Optical_Component_Designer":  this directory contains code for automatic optimization (using a third party particle swarm optimizer) with real-time simulation of novel optical components known as metasurfaces. The directory also contains code for proper logging of errors for easy debugging, and ANSYS Lumerical API interaction code for proper simulation setup and data extraction.
